# Brain_tumour_image_classification

This project aims to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using TensorFlow to classify brain MRI images into different tumor types and visualize predictions using an interactive Streamlit web app.

# Project Overview

Brain tumors are life-threatening conditions that require early diagnosis.

This project uses deep learning (CNN) to automatically classify MRI brain scans into one of the following categories:

🧩 Glioma Tumor

🧠 Meningioma Tumor

⚪ No Tumor (Healthy)

🩺 Pituitary Tumor

The trained model is deployed as a Streamlit app for real-time image prediction.
